    "In Python, a for loop begins with the keyword `for`, followed by an expression using the `in` keyword that defines the loop variable (`row` in the documentation example above), and the collection of data to select values from for the loop variable (`spamreader` in the documentation example above). The statement ends in a colon `:`, indicating to Python to expect a block following the statement. The block is the set of instructions to repeat for each value in the collection of data. In the documentation example above, the block contains a single statement: `print(', '.join(row))`.\n",
